# `mrl`: modular RL

This is a modular RL code base for research. The intent is to enable surgical modifications by designing the base agent as a list of modules that all live inside the agent's global namespace (so they can all access each other directly by name). This means we can change the algorithm of a complex hierarchical, multi-goal, intrinsically motivated, etc. agent from DDPG to SAC by simply changing the algorithm module (and adding the additional critic network). Similarly, to add something like a forward model, intrinsic motivation, landmark generation, a new HER strategy, etc., you only need to create/modify the relevant module(s). 

The agent has life-cycle hooks that the modules "hook" into. The important ones are: `_setup` (called after all modules are set but before any environment interactions), `_process_experience` (called with each new experience), `_optimize` (called at each optimization step), `save/load` (called upon saving / loading the agent). 

See comments in `mrl/agent_base.py`, brief test scripts in `tests`, and example TD3/SAC Mujoco agents in `experiments/benchmarks/train_online_agent.py`. 

The modular structure is technically framework agnostic, so could be used with either Pytorch or TF-based modules, or even a mix, but right now all modules that need a framework use Pytorch. 

Train loop is easily customized, so that you can do, e.g., BatchRL, transfer, or meta RL with minimal modifications. 

Environment parallelization is done via VecEnv, and we rely on GPU for optimization parallelization. Future work should consider how they can be done asynchronously; e.g., using [Ray](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 


### Performance Benchmarks

mrl provides state of the art implementations of SAC, TD3, and DDPG+HER. See the [Mujoco and Multi-goal benchmarks](https://github.com/spitis/mrl/blob/master/experiments/benchmarks/readme.md). 


## Installation

There is a `requirements.txt` that was works with venv:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then `pip install` the appropriate version of `Pytorch` by following the instructions here: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.

To run `Mujoco` environments you need to have the Mujoco binaries and a license key. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py#obtaining-the-binaries-and-license-key).

To test run:

```
pytest tests
PYTHONPATH=./ python experiments/mega/train_mega.py --env FetchReach-v1 --layers 256 256 --max_steps 5000
```

The first command should have 3/3 success.
The second command should solve the environment in <1 minute (better than -5 avg test reward). 

## Usage

To understand how the code works, read `mrl/agent_base.py`. 

See `tests/test_agent_sac.py` and `experiments/benchmarks` for example usage. The basic outline is as follows:

1. Construct a config object that contains all the agent hyperparameters and modules. There are some existing base configs / convenience methods for creating default SAC/TD3/DDPG agents (see, e.g., the benchmarks code). If you use `argparse` you can use a config object automatically populate the parser using `parser = add_config_args(parser, config)`. 
2. Call `mrl.config_to_agent` on the config to get back an agent. 
3. Use the agent however you want; e.g., call its train/eval methods, save/load, module methods, and so on. 

To add functionality or a new algorithm, you generally just need to define a one or more modules that hook into the agent's lifecycle methods and add them to the config. They automatically hook into the agent's lifecycle methods, so the rest of the code can stay the same.
